# About JET

Welcome to the Japan Exchange and Teaching (JET) Program. Founded in 1987, JET has sent more than 60,000 global participants (including nearly 32,000 Americans) to work in schools, boards of education, and government offices throughout Japan. What makes JET unique is that it is the only teaching exchange program managed by the government of Japan. With more than 40 countries around the world participating in JET, this program offers a unique cultural exchange opportunity to meet people from all around the world, living and working in Japan. Before departing for Japan and upon return, there are a number of JET alumni organizations that host social, volunteer and professional development activities to help individuals through the transition process. Becoming a JET puts you in an elite network of incredible individuals. Join us for the adventure of a lifetime!
